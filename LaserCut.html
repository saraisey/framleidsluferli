                                    <h3>The Project</h3>
                                    This project was to design and manufacture a prototype of a laser cut press fit set without any type of adhesive. The design was to be designed with the help of fixed parameters so that it could easily be altered. 
								    <h3>My Idea</h3>
                                    <p>I have a cat named Lísa, and I really wanted to do something to make her eating process more effective. Thus I desided to design a simple cat feeder.</p>
                                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                                    <p>I had a pretty clear idea of what I would like to draw so I went straight to Fusion 360 and started sketching my design with a help of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE">video</a> the teacher pointed out. I will not go through the drawing process of the feeder in this article, as that would be very lengthy. The final design can be seen on this photo below.</p>

									<p>I began by putting in user parameters in Fusion 360, such as the height and with of the box. Every dimension of the feeder is a function of these parameters.</p><img src="images/parameterspress.png" alt="open terminal at folder" style="width:600px;height:300px;"/>
                                    <p>I intended to put the kerf into the drawing by hand, but opted not to after careful consideration (because it seemed more work than necessary), and followed instructions in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKBxSx3Tv1k&ab_channel=HobbyistMaker">video</a> to do so once the CAD was ready. This video also took me step by step through the process of making a DXF file from my design. Once I had followed all of the steps in said video, I turned to inkscape with my DXF file and processed it (combining lines and nodes and laying the forms side by side) until I was happy.</p><img src="images/pressDXF.png" alt="open terminal at folder" style="width:600px;height:600px;"/>
